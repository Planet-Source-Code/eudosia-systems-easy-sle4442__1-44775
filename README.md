### Description

I think this is the first example on PSC of managing Smart Card reader and memory card handling. It's my first submission, a few line of code but with great contents. It's anx OCx to manage read/write of an SLE4442 memory card with a RS232 generic smart card reader. Code is full implemented with basic functions and is a great HOWTO for MSCOmm programmers. To see it works you must have a rs232 smart card reader(for my work I tried with ELV reader www.elv.de). Sorry, the code is well commented but in Italian. Vote for me and make me a winner!! Also I hope this can help developers community.
